# Module 02 — Garden Guardian  
Data Engineering for Smart Agriculture

## Objective

This module focuses on building **robust and fault-tolerant programs** using Python’s exception handling system.

The project simulates a smart agriculture environment where sensor data may be invalid, missing, or corrupted.  
The goal is to ensure that programs handle errors gracefully without crashing.

## What You Learn

- Using `try` / `except` blocks
- Handling different types of errors
- Creating custom exception classes
- Raising your own errors
- Using `finally` for cleanup
- Building resilient systems that continue running after failures

---

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Anticipate and manage runtime errors
- Write safe and reliable programs
- Design systems that remain stable even when unexpected problems occur
- Provide clear and helpful error messages

This module teaches how to build **real-world reliable software**.
